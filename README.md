# GIS_HonsProj_V2
GIS Honours project, Version 2, Created on Computer in Mike Lab

This project is looking at the distribution of Proteaceae species (Specifically Aulax and Leucadendron) data across the Western Cape, using ProteaAtlas data. This is then being overlayed with fire data from SANBI. From this we can then determine where there are certain Protea species that have not been burnt in the last 15+ years.
